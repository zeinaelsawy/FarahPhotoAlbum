                <p class="sp1">This song is about all of the people in the artist's life who she can't be around to support them through their problems. They also can't be around her all of the time to encourage her through anything she's going through.  Because you don't always have somebody else to tell you what you need to hear, you sometimes need to tell yourself everything you need to hear. One of the first lines is a play on the aphorism<span id="dots">...</span>

                “Look both ways before you cross the street.” In this context, Bootsy alludes to being cautious when crossing one’s mind. Many of us grow up with someone continuously picking on us. People don't consider how much the small things you say to each other can have an impact on you.

                The importance of self-reliance is the major message of this song. Self-sufficiency is crucial. You're nothing without everyone around you if you don't have self-reliance, self-awareness, and the ability to pick yourself up by yourself. You must rely solely on yourself. You must be dependent on the understanding that you are the only thing you have in the world. You don't have to believe you've lost just because everything around you suggests you have.

                "The sun'll come out," she sings, emphasizing that the struggle is just temporary. She used wordplay to represent a variety of elements of the song. Showers in April bring flowers in May, for example. Going through the darkness with rain pouring down on you, and then all of a sudden, the clouds part, and the sun shines down on you in the most befitting manner, and then a rainbow appears. The umbrella is a metaphor for Kali's support in the second verse, as it protects Tyler. The use of an umbrella also corresponds to the song title, since an umbrella would be used to protect you from the metaphorical storm. The bridge is about working hard, fully committing to whatever you want to do, and going for it. It's difficult to sympathize with the reality that things can be difficult. Everyone wants to be successful right away. Overnight success is rare, and it isn't always sustainable.
